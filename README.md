# Mathematica-Packages

My personal Mathematica-Packages that I've used extensively during my PhD.

## ListStylePlot.m
Custom ListPlot[] function to get plots in publishable style by manipulating Mathematica's ListPlot options to different default values. Another option value can easily be chosen by simply specifying that option in the ListStylePlot[] call. An example of the default is given below.


## ModList.m
Package for easy manipulation of Mathematica lists by using a simplistic mixture of function-mapping and range-based loops.
